Fortunately, you took 16.413 at MIT and recall learning about sampling-based planning methods--in particular Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT). You decide to first tackle this problem with RRT. We chose RRT over graph search primarily due to the curse of dimensionality as highlighted in the course. For a better path, we would like to discretize our map further which exponentially increases the node size in case of a graph search algoithm. Further, we can also incoporate our agent's dynamics using RRT since we simulate forward (much harder to implement in probabilistic roadmap planning).\n",

Another variation is that after a vertex is added to the lowest cost neighbor, the tree is rewired to the new vertex in order to decrease individual cost. In the the iterative process:\n",

    "Now that your drone shipments are up and running with an optimized schedule, your team has begun using the each drone's sensors to capture additional data.  Each drone is equipped with an infrared (IR) camera and a visible spectrum camera. With these camera systems you have been able to make some extremely valuable observations of wildlife to include a possible sighting of Sasquatch (image shown below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=Bigfoot_Picture.png style=\"width: 60%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, you have encountered some issues with these camera systems that, in absence of an accurate diagnosis, require the drones to be sent back to your university to repair. This process takes several weeks. As a result, drone camera malfunctions are quite quite costly as you must choose to either (a) negatively affect the supply delivery schedule by sending the drone home for repairs, or (b) losing the opportunity to make observations during your supply runs or observation missions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You believe you are very close to finding a Sasquatch village, so you decide to take a look at the system schematic to see if there is a way you can diagnose malfunctions based on the system behavior. The schematic is shown below. In the image below, \n",

    "Each component is modular and easily accessible when the drone is in-hand and hence it can be repaire easily if you can correctly identify the problem. Unfortunately the drone's software only activates the camera systems when the drone is airborne so it is not possible to troubleshoot this issue by measuring voltages or some other method. Instead you (or maybe it occurs to you, an algorithm) must reason based on the system's behavior.  \n",

    "In normal operation, the power relays provide power whenever they are supplied. The power conditioining units (PCUs) output synchronzied, conditioned power for the cameras whenever it is supplied with power from two power relays. The infrared and visibile spectrum cameras capture and store images whenever they are supplied with power from a PCU.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a power relay fails, it will not provide power when supplied. A faulty PCU may not provide conditioned power even if both of its power relays are providing power. Additionally, a faulty PCU may provide \"conditioned\" power even if only one power relay is providing power (power supplied in such a state will lead to degraded images with either a faulty camera or a normal camera). However, a faulty PCU cannot provide power in absence of any supplied power. If a camera fails, it may not capture images even if provided with conditioned power.\n",

    "Based on this model and the associated probabilities, you decide to implement conflict-directed A*. To implement this, you know you need to take a set of observations (specified by the states of D and E), inputs (specified by the states of A, B, and C) and use these to generate conflicts to search through the tree.  Moreoever, you know you should start your search with the moste likely system configuration--namely, that all components are working normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this as a starting-point, conflict-directed A* will leverage De Morgan's Theorem to generate kernels that *could* explain the system behavior. It will then iteratively select the best kernel (most likely kernel) and assign the remaining unassigned components to their most likely state. If it observes a conflict, it will continue with this process recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, the most likely conflicts will be generated in order of probability for a given behavior.\n",
