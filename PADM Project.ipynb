This makes maintaining a continuous research presence extremely difficult as weather events, unexpected supply shortages, and other operational issues often lead to dangerously low provisions at the research sites--forcing the scientists to return intermittently to ensure the safety of the team.\n",

Fortunately, you took 16.413 at MIT and recall learning about sampling-based planning methods--in particular Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT). You decide to first tackle this problem with RRT. We chose RRT over graph search primarily due to the curse of dimensionality as highlighted in the course. For a better path, we would like to discretize our map further which exponentially increases the node size in case of a graph search algoithm. Further, we can also incoporate our agent's dynamics using RRT since we simulate forward (much harder to implement in probabilistic roadmap planning).\n",
