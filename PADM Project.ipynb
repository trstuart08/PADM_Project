    "The situation is we are using a vehicle (rover or drone) to deliver food kits from the basecamp to 5 destinations distributed around the base camp. Each destination has a weekly demand in terms of weight and volume. The vehicle also has certain weight and volume restrictions. We are assuming there are atleast 2 different type of vehicles which vary in terms of both weight and volume capacity. THe problem is to find a way to identify on a delivery plan to fulfil the demand at the lowest cost."

The basic idea is to use the RRT/RRT* to determine the shortest distance from the base camp to each of the destinations and among all destinations. This distance will be later used as an input into the mathematical program.\n",
